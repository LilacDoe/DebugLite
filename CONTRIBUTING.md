# Contributing Guidelines

## License Precedence

Wherever a contradiction between this document and the License exist, the License shall take priority.

## Maintenance

Honestly, I do not expect to maintain this software or only as necessary. I do not check my GitHub messages often, but I will respond when I see it... eventually.

## Forking

Given the above, please just fork the repository and remove the `lilacdoe` prefix. I'm sure whatever you do is likely to be an improvement for the community if you actively maintain it.

## Contributions

If for some reason you would like to contribute to this version in particular, please follow the standard code of conduct.

## TL;DR

I made this for me, but decided to share. If you'd like to improve it, just fork it and do as you please.
